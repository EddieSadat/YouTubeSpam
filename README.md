# YouTubeSpam
An algorithm to identify YouTube comments as Spam or Ham (real human responses).

With the rise of AI accessibility and usage, LLMs in particular, social media has been flooded with 'bot' comments, or comments that were written and posted by an automated process. The use of LLMs in these cases are often impecable at replicating human text behaviour. As a result, the Spam detection in this project is very likely to fail in the modern landscape; It was trained on data nearly a decade old when Spam comments were generally more distinct with true spammy behaviour (random characters, illegible, awkward). While it can still be useful to use this model for spam detection, it's clear to me that additional layers and models need to be created to address the rise in advanced human-text replication. And for anyone who has been active on YouTube or other platforms in recent years, especially in 2025, they have seen the clear gap in this regard since comment sections remain to be flooded with a staggering amount of bot comments.
